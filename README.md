# Marketing Response Prediction

This project builds a predictive pipeline for a marketing campaign using real customer data. By combining clustering and classification models, it segments audiences and scores their likelihood to respond—enabling more personalized, efficient, and ROI-focused targeting.

## Objectives
- Segment customers using unsupervised clustering (KMeans)
- Predict campaign response using Lasso and Logistic Regression
- Link behaviour to the 4Ps of Marketing (Product, Promotion, Place, People)
- Generate actionable insights for marketing strategy and CRM systems

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering and Scaling
- KMeans Clustering
- Lasso Regression with Cross-Validation
- Model Evaluation: RMSE, R², Confusion Matrix, Lift
- Business Interpretation and Strategic Recommendations

## Dataset
- Source: Simulated marketing campaign dataset for academic use
- Variables include demographics, product category spending, campaign responses, and purchase channels

## Key Takeaways
- Prior campaign engagement, income, and product spending are strong predictors of campaign success
- Clustering revealed high-ROI customer segments suitable for targeted marketing
- Predictive scores can be used to optimize campaign audience selection, messaging, and budget allocation

## Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
